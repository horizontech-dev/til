# Os-Systemd

- During the boot, OS decides which will be the init system. 
- From the ref `The system initialization process is handled by the `init` daemon. In [squeeze](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianSqueeze) and earlier releases, that daemon is provided by the sysvinit package, and no alternatives are supported. In [wheezy](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianWheezy), the default init daemon is still sysvinit, but a "technology preview" of [systemd](https://wiki.debian.org/systemd) is available. In [jessie](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianJessie) and [stretch](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianStretch), the default init system is [systemd](https://wiki.debian.org/systemd), but switching to sysvinit is supported.`

- To change that in GCE, I had to reboot the machine
